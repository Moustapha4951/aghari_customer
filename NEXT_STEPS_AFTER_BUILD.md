# Next Steps: After Building Your `aghari_customer` iOS App

Congratulations on successfully building your `.ipa` file! Here's a guide to your next steps for App Store submission:

## 1. Locate Your IPA File

*   As a reminder, the generated `.ipa` file is located in your project directory at:
    `aghari_customer/build/ios/ipa/`

## 2. Upload to App Store Connect

You have two primary tools for uploading your `.ipa` file to App Store Connect:

*   **Transporter app:**
    *   This is Apple's dedicated application for macOS designed for uploading builds to App Store Connect.
    *   Download it from the Mac App Store, log in with your Apple Developer account, and follow the prompts to upload your `.ipa` file.

*   **Xcode (Organizer):**
    *   While `flutter build ipa` generates the `.ipa` directly, you can still use Xcode to upload it.
    *   Open Xcode, go to Window > Organizer.
    *   In the Organizer, you can import your `.ipa` file and then use the "Distribute App" button to upload it to App Store Connect.
    *   You will need to be logged into your Apple Developer account in Xcode (Xcode > Settings > Accounts).

## 3. Manage Your Build in App Store Connect

Once your build is successfully uploaded, it will appear in your App Store Connect account:

*   **Access Portal:** Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) and log in.
*   **Find Your Build:** Navigate to your `aghari_customer` app. The uploaded build will typically appear under the "TestFlight" tab first. From there, you can assign it to testers or promote it to the "App Store" tab for release submission.

*   **Complete Submission Requirements:** Before you can submit your app for review, you'll need to:
    *   **Metadata:** Fill in all required information such as your app's description, keywords, pricing and availability, contact information, and privacy policy URL.
    *   **Visuals:** Upload screenshots and app previews for all required device sizes.
    *   **Compliance:** Complete any necessary compliance forms (e.g., age rating, use of the advertising identifier (IDFA), export compliance if applicable).
    *   **Build Selection:** Ensure the correct build is selected for your new app version.

*   **Submit for Review:** Once everything is complete, you can submit your app version to Apple for review.

## 4. Consult Official Documentation

*   **Apple's App Store Connect Help** is your best resource for the most detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information on the app submission process. The App Store Connect interface and Apple's requirements can change over time.
